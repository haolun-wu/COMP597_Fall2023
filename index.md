Course Overview 
This is an advanced undergraduate level / graduate-level course for students who are interested in learning how to apply machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. We will start with a quick review of machine learning basics and then focus on a few selected interesting (subjective) topics including computer systems, communication networks, transportation systems, smart grid, and medical applications. We will also discuss some high-impact industry machine learning products and the research problems behind their successes. The class consists of instructor lectures, student-led presentations, class discussions, and class projects. The main topics that are covered in this course are listed as follows.

Course Syllabus  

Course Introduction, Elements of Research (How to be successful), How to read papers (Week 1)
Review of Machine Learning Skills (Week 2)
Machine Learning for Networks (Week 3)
Machine Learning for Recommender Systems (Week 4)
Reinforcement Learning and its applications in e-commerce (Week 5)
Introduction to Large Language Models and their Applications (Week 6)
Project topic presentation – Phase 0 (Week 7)
Advanced Generative Models: VAE, GAN, Flow-based Model, Diffusion (Week 8)

Course Student Presentations start
Project progress presentation — Phase I (Week 9)
Large Language Models and their applications (Week 10)
Machine Learning for Medical Applications (drug discovery, diagnoses etc, Week 11)
Project progress presentations/initial demo – Phase II (Week 12)
Machine Learning for Smart Grids and Energy Systems (Week 13)
Overview of Research Challenges to Bring Machine Learning to Real-World Applications (Week 14)
Project report due/final demo (Week 15)


Textbooks: Due to the nature of this course, many topics are not available in any textbook yet. Hence there is no required textbook. Instead, we will use many publications, technical notes or materials available from the Internet. 

Course evaluation:

Class participation/presentations (class topic presentation, and project progress checkpoint presentations/demo(s) ) : 35%
Class presentation topic summary/survey paper:  30%
Project and final report: 35%  

Total 100%

Note: In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University’s control, the evaluation scheme in a Course is subject to change, provided that there be timely communications to the students regarding the change.


Final project: Two intermediate (milestone) presentations are needed for your final project. These presentations/demos are expected to receive proper feedbacks on your project. Also, these milestone presentations/demos could help you pace the project for timely completion. Every final project must have a final report (and other associated materials, such as software programs) submitted for final grading. 


Late project policy: There will be a strict deadline for the final project (the week before the final exams – subject to change). Please pay close attention to the announcements during the course. It is your responsibility to make sure that the final project report (and its associated materials, if any) is properly submitted via Git.
